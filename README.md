# UsefulMaterialsForLearners

## What/Why is this?

Through the years I've spent at university (especially in graduate school) and now in the workforce, I've often felt it a shame that students, colleagues \& researchers alike so frequently create great content, discussing interesting topics, just to have them seen only a handful of times by live audiences in classes or at talks \& meetings. Because of this, I've decided to create this repository with the idea that, at least, any contents I've worked on and found interesting can be shared for other curious peoples. 

## Who is this for?

In short? Anybody interested in math/stats/data science and analytics. The materials I plan to post here will probably span different levels of technicality from high-level introductions, to explicit explanations of methods. Although, most will probably be dumped from my own presentations, meaning they may be written for people with at least some technical background.
